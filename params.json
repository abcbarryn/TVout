{"name":"Arduino-tvout","tagline":"TVout library for the Arduino Uno, Mega, and Leonardo","body":"This branch of the TVout library has been patched to allow use with the Arduino Leonardo.\r\nThe goal of this project is to create a simple interupt driven library for generating composite video on a single AVR chip.\r\n\r\nCurrently the output is NTSC or PAL at a resolution of 128x96 by default. The library currently works on ATmega168,328,1280,2560,644p,1284p,32U4,AT90USB1286 and more can be added by editing spec/hardware_setup.h.\r\n\r\nThere are some timing issues with the m1284p, may be related to sanguino core.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMCU         SYNC\tVIDEO\tAUDIO\tArduino\t        SYNC\tVIDEO\t  AUDIO\r\nm168,m328\tB 1\t    D 7\t    B 3\t    NG,Decimila,UNO\t9\t    7\t      11\r\nm1280,m2560\tB 5\t    A 7\t    B 4\t    Mega            11\t    A7(D29)\t  10\r\nm644,m1284p\tD 5\t    A 7\t    D 7\t    sanguino        13\t    A7(D24)\t  8\r\nm32u4       B 5\t    B 4\t    B 7\t    Leonardo        9       8         11\r\nAT90USB1286\tB 5\t    F 7\t    B 4\t    --\t            --\t    --\t      --\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-68683975-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
